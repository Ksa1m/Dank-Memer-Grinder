### Automatically types these commands:
- postmemes
- search
- crime
- beg
- hunt
- stream

For it to work you always have to be in the discord window.

- Tips can break commands with mouse clicks, so I recommend disabling them in Dank memer settings

- If you don't have required python libraries installed, run `pip install pyautogui customtkinter keyboard` in cmd

- It is recommended running the bot in Dank memer DMs or in separate server because if anyone sends messages in the same channel as you, commands might not work

## Config

- Set to true if you have stream unlocked. To check, type /stream in dankmemer
  - Stream unlocked


- If you want the window to stay on top
  - Window enabled

- Doesn't type commands that could get you killed, like /search, to prevent you from losing money if you do die
  - Safe mode

- If the commands don't register and you type /hunt like a normal text, instead of a command, then you need to increase this
  - Load time

- Key to toggle the bot
